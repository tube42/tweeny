Tweeny
======

Tweeny is a Java tweening library. It is my latest experiment with tweening techniques. 

The library is not very efficient at the moment, so don't use it in any important projects ;)


When to use it?
---------------

Tweeny may be of use to you if 
 1) you need a tiny tweening library, with the simplest possible API
 2) you have very few tweened objects (or don't care about memory usage)
 3) you sometimes want to specify assignment speed instead of tween sequences (i.e. something like Behavior in QML)
 

WHY?
----
Why another tweening library? Because I wanted to experiment with some animation techniques and couldn't get the existing ones to work to my liking.
